Your output files containing EM field responses will be located here.

Reference solutions on medium quality mesh (q1.3) for the test example 'CSEM_input_model' are also located here. Note, that only the strongest field components (Ex and Hy) are sufficiently accurate on this mesh.

You can use the Jupyther Notebook to plot the data.
