@article{Um2020,
   abstract = {The borehole-to-surface electromagnetic (EM) method is a viable imaging and monitoring tool for energy reservoirs, geologic storage, geothermal exploration, fault zones, and other subsurface targets. Data interpretation typically requires considering steel-casing effects, but it is difficult and impractical to directly discretize arbitrarily oriented hollow steel-cased wells in a 3D reservoir-scale earth model because of their extremely high electrical conductivity and long hollow geometry. We have considered a borehole-to-surface EM configuration in which an electric dipole source is placed below the bottom of a steel-cased well. To practically simulate the casing effects on EM measurements, we develop a novel 3D finite-element EM algorithm using an unstructured tetrahedral mesh. To avoid excessive use of fine grids for modeling a steel-cased well, the well is replaced with the combination of a short solid conductive prism and a long linewise perfect electric conductor. We find that this combined structure can approximate casing effects at a small fraction of the computational cost required for modeling a complete hollow casing because the linewise structure is volumeless and does not require an excessive number of small elements. We also find that steel-cased wells distant from sources and receivers can be modeled as simple linewise perfect electric conductors, further improving the computational efficiency. Using this approximation, the 3D EM algorithm presented here is well-suited to modeling many arbitrarily oriented steel-cased wells. After verifying the accuracy and efficiency of this approach using various examples, we performed a 3D borehole-to-surface/surface-to-borehole and surface EM inversion and determine that the inversion can image a deep localized target in the presence of steel infrastructure.},

@article{Heagy2017,
   abstract = {Simulations and inversions of electromagnetic geophysical data are paramount for discerning meaningful information about the subsurface from these data. Depending on the nature of the source electromagnetic experiments may be classified as time-domain or frequency-domain. Multiple heterogeneous and sometimes anisotropic physical properties, including electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability, may need be considered in a simulation. Depending on what one wants to accomplish in an inversion, the parameters which one inverts for may be a voxel-based description of the earth or some parametric representation that must be mapped onto a simulation mesh. Each of these permutations of the electromagnetic problem has implications in a numerical implementation of the forward simulation as well as in the computation of the sensitivities, which are required when considering gradient-based inversions. This paper proposes a framework for organizing and implementing electromagnetic simulations and gradient-based inversions in a modular, extensible fashion. We take an object-oriented approach for defining and organizing each of the necessary elements in an electromagnetic simulation, including: the physical properties, sources, formulation of the discrete problem to be solved, the resulting fields and fluxes, and receivers used to sample to the electromagnetic responses. A corresponding implementation is provided as part of the open source simulation and parameter estimation project SIMPEG (http://simpeg.xyz). The application of the framework is demonstrated through two synthetic examples and one field example. The first example shows the application of the common framework for 1D time domain and frequency domain inversions. The second is a field example that demonstrates a 1D inversion of electromagnetic data collected over the Bookpurnong Irrigation District in Australia. The final example is a 3D example which shows how the modular implementation is used to compute the sensitivity for a parametric model where a transmitter is positioned inside a steel cased well.},
